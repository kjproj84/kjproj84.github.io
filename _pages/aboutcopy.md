I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). I am a member of the Software Innovations Lab, advised by [Prof. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/). My research interests are Systems end of Software Engineering. Previously, I worked in Robotics Research at [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/kist_web/main/) and access R&D team at [SK telesys](http://www.sktelesys.com/eng/). And I hold my masters degree from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/).

My research is to facilitate the evolutionary modifications of distributed apps via automatic and architectural refactorings. My work enables localizing bugs in distributed apps, optimizing distribution granularity, and safely replicating cloud services for edge-based or centralized computing. My approach improves software engineering’s latest ideas such as declarative program analysis, fuzzing/checkpointing execution, sandboxing, and program transformation.
