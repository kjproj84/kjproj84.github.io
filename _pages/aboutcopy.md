I received Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). I was a member of the Software Innovations Lab, advised by [Prof. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/). My research interests are Systems end of Software Engineering. Previously, I worked in Robotics Research at [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/kist_web/main/) and access R&D team at [SK telesys](http://www.sktelesys.com/eng/). And I completed my masters degree from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hwangjun Song](http://mcnl.postech.ac.kr/professor).

<ul>
<li>
My research proposed a new refactoring to create a centralized variant of distributed apps to facilitate re-engineering of distributed apps/cloud services. My idea solved non-trivial tasks for evolving distributed apps: efficiently localizing bugs, optimizing distribution granularity, and replicating a subset of distributed apps into different machines for enabling edge-based/centralized computing. (related to Serverless computing). My approach improves software engineering‚Äôs latest ideas such as declarative program analysis with z3 engine, fuzzing/checkpointing web execution, and replication in distributed systems. My dissertation idea was published in ‚ÄãtheWebConf 2020 and awarded as the Best paper in ICWE 2021. And two of other papers were nominated for the best paper awards.
