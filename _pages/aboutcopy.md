Kijin An is a software engineer/researcher at the Software Engineering Team in [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/) in Seoul, currently, he is developing an AI Coding assistant tool based on LLMs. He is interested in how agentic workflow, reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, or RAG affect the coding performance employing LLMs.

Prior to that, he received his Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by [Prof. Eli Tilevich](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/). Also, he worked in [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/kist_web/main/) and completed his master's degree from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hwangjun Song](http://mcnl.postech.ac.kr/professor).
